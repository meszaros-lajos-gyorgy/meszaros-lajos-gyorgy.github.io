Todos:
	- allow to input Hz for strings
	- allow to edit harmonics limit(currently 100)
	- displaying cents
	- display ratio names, when a certain ratio is set (3/2 and 2/3 should trigger the displaying of 'pure fifth')
	- alternative waveforms (audioContext.createPeriodicWave())
	- minimal design for the textarea, so that it becomes larger
	- normalize ids in _export()
	- 'assign set to key' feature (sets could be assigned to a keyboard key and sets could be played as a piano)
	- import/export to Dave Ryan's notation/format (http://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1508/1508.07739.pdf)
	- import from .scl file or using an inline editor, general support for the scala format
	- midi support
	- method to compare sets, when ratios are getting compared (125/124 should be gained as the diff between 25/21 and 6/5)
